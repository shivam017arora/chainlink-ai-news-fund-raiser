## CharityGPT
CharityGPT, an AI model specifically designed for parsing news headlines to classify whether a DAO should raise funds or not. 

## Overview
This Flask application provides an API service for fetching news relevant to specific charity categories. It interfaces with a news API and an LLM (Language Learning Model) to filter headlines suitable for raising funds for charities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/shivam017arora/chainlink-ai-news-fund-raiser.git
cd chainlink-ai-news-fund-raiser
```


2. **Install the requirements**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` that will store your environment variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations.

4. **Run the Flask application**

```sh
python serv.py
```

By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:8912`.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
pytest
```

### Endpoint: `/api/charity`

#### Method: `POST`

#### Description:
This endpoint accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing a 'category' field. It fetches news related to the specified charity category and returns headlines suitable for raising funds for charities.

#### Request Format:
```json
{
    "category": "string"
}
```

#### Response Format:
```json
{
    "result": "array or string (depending on LLM response)"
}
```

#### Status Codes:
- `201 Created`: The request was successful, and relevant news headlines are returned.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request is invalid (e.g., missing required fields).

#### Example Usage:

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8912/api/charity \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"category": "health"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "result": ["Headline 1 relevant to health category", "Headline 2 relevant to health category"]
}
```

# Future Scope

1. Enhanced Source Selection
Future versions of this application could include the ability to customize news sources. Users could specify preferred news sources or exclude certain sources, offering more tailored news aggregation.

2. Broader Language Support
Expanding the application to support multiple languages can make the service accessible to a more diverse user base and global charity organizations.

3. Advanced Filtering Options
Implementing advanced filtering based on keywords, date ranges, or specific geographic locations can refine the news results, making the service more relevant and effective for users.

4. Integration with Social Media Platforms
Allowing the app to fetch and analyze news from social media platforms could provide more real-time and grassroots-level insights, which are crucial for some charity campaigns.

5. User Interface for Non-Technical Users
Developing a user-friendly web interface can make the application more accessible to non-technical users, allowing charities to leverage this tool without needing programming knowledge.
